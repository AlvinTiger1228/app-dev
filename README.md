The series started with a girl wearing a bunny girl suit inside a library, but no noticed her, except one high school student who just passed by.
When the boy noticed her, they stared at each other for a while, and the girl walked outside saying to the boy, *Don't talk to someone about what you saw earlier.*, and walked away.

The boy knew who the girl was, a former child actress that went on a hiatus. Puzzled, the boy first asked if he liked a bunny girl. He also asked if he knew the girl he saw at the library, and he said *Of course, she's very famous.* 
The boy was about to forget on what he saw, when he spotted her waiting on a train going home. The girl knew who she was and asked *Didn't I told you to forget what you saw at the library?* He replied *how could I?* 
One way or another, both crossed paths once again and the girl finally stated the reason she wore the bunny girl suit, **she's invisible to some people and couldn't recognize her.** The boy thought of an absurd reason why this happened, to which the girl confirmed the cause, **Adolescence Syndrome**.
